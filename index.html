		<h2>Aims and Scope</h2>
		<div class="piece left red">
			<blockquote cite="https://okfn.org/">A world where knowledge creates power for the many, not the few.
				A world where data frees us to make informed choices about how we live, what we buy and who gets our vote.
				A world where information and insights are accessible and apparent to everyone.
				This is the world we choose.</blockquote>
				
			<p>This claim, reported in the <a href="https://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation web 
			site</a>, is an effective summary of the open knowledge movement thought and aims.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="piece right blue">
			<p>Cultural Heritage play a fundamental role in human knowledge: it is the core part 
			of the whole corpus of human knowledge itself and, in addition, a deep understanding of 
			cultural heritage can provide humans of powerful means to advance their own knowledge 
			and  to make them <em>free</em>.</p> 
			
			<p>Thus, following the open knowledge vision, providing open and full access to
			everyone to the cultural heritage and to data, studies and documents about it will empower
			social, scientific, technical and cultural progress of people and of the whole human 
			society.</p> 
		</div>		 

		<div class="piece center yellow">	
			<p>The aim of the <em>Open Knowledge Open Arts workshop</em> is to investigate how sharing
			knowledge and opening data, in a machine readable form and with limitation on reuse, can 
			help research, production and fruition of cultural heritage.</p>
